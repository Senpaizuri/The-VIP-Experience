# The Vip Experience

The Digital space is awesome!
Alas, not for everyone. Most VIPs (Visually Impaired People) don't even use the internet or give it out of hand to the visually able.
That's why I'm trying to create a _fun_ and *pleasureable* digital web exprience.
This repo wil contain all my trails and tribulations regarding my bachelors thesis!
